# CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets for [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/). 

Throughout this course, I developed a deep understanding of full-stack web development, focusing on backend logic with **Django** and frontend interactivity with **JavaScript**.
